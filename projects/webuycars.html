          This project presents a brief exploratory data analysis of 31,851 cars listed on WeBuyCars, scraped between 25 February and 23 April 2025. The analysis
          examines the market composition, geographical distribution of stock, as well as price and mileage patterns by make. Finally, it assesses the relationship 
          between key features and price, ultimately making use of a random forest to identify key drivers of vehicle pricing across different price thresholds.

          This brief EDA covers active listings that were present on the <a href="https://www.webuycars.co.za/buy-a-car" target="_blank">WeBuyCars</a> website over 
          the 2 month scraping period. It provides a concise breakdown of the available data and highlights insights I was particularly interested in exploring.

          70% of WeBuyCars' scraped inventory is concentrated across Gauteng and the Western Cape with the former making up nearly half of all listings. Gauteng's dominance isn't surprising given that the once-iconic
          Coca-Cola Dome, now the <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/motoring/500395-webuycars-bought-the-dome-for-r175-million.html" target="_blank">WeBuyCars Dome</a>, houses more than 1,500 vehicles -
          interestingly sells approximately 2,000 vehicles per month from the flagship. Notably, the scraped data showed no stock in the Northern Cape or Free State.

          The negative relationship between price and mileage is clear. Most cars cluster between 100k-200k km and R100k-R250k, while vehicles beyond 300k km see prices bottom out - with only a few high-end models 
          resisting typical depreciation. For buyers, this middle band is the sweet spot, with lower prices and cars that haven't yet crossed into 'end-of-life' mileage.

          Mileage and price distributions are skewed rightward: most cars sit below 200k km and under R300k, but long tails emerge from high-mileage cars and premium models. Toyotas and Nissans
          often appear at higiher mileage, indicating durability, while brands like BMW and Mercedes dominate the upper price ranges despite modest mileage. The ridgeplots underscore two parallel
          markets, one driven by durability and the other by luxury.

          In the second-hand market, mileage patterns often highlight how different brands are used and valued. Some manufacturers are more likely to appear with lower mileage and higher price tags, 
          reflecting shorter driving cycles or quicker ownership turnover. Others show up with higher mileage, pointing to cars built for endurance and long-distance use. Recognising these brand-specific 
          habits helps buyers focus on vehicles that combine reliability, strong resale, and long-term appeal.

              - Vehicle prices follow a predictable depreciation curve. A sharp decline in the first 10 years, then a flatting as cars age further. Once a car cross the decade mark, age becomes less of a differentiator - 
              at that point other features matter more (we'll be looking into this kind of variable classification in the coming random forest section). This pattern demonstrates a typical car value lifecycle, where the biggest hit comes
              early, and older vehicles settle into a stable, low-value band. The labels at the end of each bar represent the number of car listings captured in that year.

              <strong>Service History</strong> 
                - Median prices clearly differ depending on service history. Cars with a 'complete, up to date' record unsurprisingly fetch the highest prices, while those with 'complete but due' trade at slightly lower levels. 
                Vehicles with no service history record see a marked drop in median value, indicating how much trust and resale confidence hinges on documented maintenance. Even after excluding cars with missing fields, it's a
                clear trend that service history is an important indicator of price. Median prices rise with documentation quality: “complete, up to date” commands the highest values, “complete but due” trades slightly lower, and 
                “no record” sees a marked drop (Empty service-history fields were excluded).

        <div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up">
          Identifying key price drivers is critical for both buyers and sellers. To achieve this, I trained a series of Random Forest classifiers in R using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ranger/index.html" target="_blank">Ranger Package</a> 
          to identify which features best predict whether a veichle's price exceeds 6 different thresholds (R60k-R1m). Variable importance scores were then extrated to compare which factors consistently matter most across different price thresholds.
        </div>

        <div class="body-text" data-aos="fade-up">
        <p>
          The chart shows relative importance scores for each feature at different price thresholds. Taller bars indicate features that help the model in distinguishing cars above or below a given price line.
          It's important to note that these are not causal effect or exact price impacts, but rather signals of which attributes are most useful for classication at that cutoff.
        </p>
      <br>
        <p>
          Age and mileage are the strongest and most consistent drivers of price, reflecting the same trends found in earlier sections. Make and model become increasingly decisive at higher thresholds, where brand luxury pushes
          price upward. Vehicle size proxies such as gross vehicle mass (GVM) gain importance in the more expensive bands, while service history adds some value but lags behind key indicators like age and mileage. Notably, mileage plays a
          smaller role at the lower end of the market, but low mileage becomes a strong differentiator once prices move past the R500k mark.
